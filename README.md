# RenderCV Pipeline

Are you ready to revolutionize the way you manage and craft your CVs and resumes?

Picture this:

1.  You simply update your `John_Doe_CV.yaml` input file and push the changes.
2.  Then, a pipeline generates a new PDF and Markdown from it and uploads it to the repository.
3.  When you are done with your work, you can create a new release on GitHub, tagging your CV with something like `v2024-04`. The pipeline will automatically add the PDF and the YAML as assets to the release.
4.  You have successfully created your CV pipeline, and all the history is in safe hands and reproducible.

**How to start?**

1.  [Click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=rendercv-pipeline&template_owner=sinaatalay) to create your CV repository based on this `rendercv-pipeline` template repository.
2.  Edit `John_Doe_CV.yaml` file and push the changes. Then, see the magic happen.

**Some tips**

1.  Learn more about [RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) to understand what you can do with this tool.
2.  Edit and preview your CV in your browser without installing anything by creating a codespace. Click the <> **Code** button, then click the **Codespaces** tab, and then click **Create codespace on main**. The environment will be ready for RenderCV usage.

# Welcome To Rendercv!

[RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) is a LaTeX CV/resume framework. It allows you to create a high-quality CV as a PDF from a YAML file with **full Markdown syntax support** and **complete control over the LaTeX code**.

A substantial part of the content is taken from [here](https://www.careercup.com/resume), where a *clean and tidy CV* pattern is proposed by **Gayle L. McDowell**.

# Quick Guide

- Each section title is arbitrary, and each section contains a list of entries.
- There are seven different entry types: *BulletEntry*, *TextEntry*, *EducationEntry*, *ExperienceEntry*, *NormalEntry*, *PublicationEntry*, and *OneLineEntry*.
- Select a section title, pick an entry type, and start writing your section!
